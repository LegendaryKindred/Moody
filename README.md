# Moody
CS 506 Team Project

In the repo, there are 6 branches: main, Test, Yoo, xian, shizhen, and rui. The last four branches are just historical branches that are used to develop the main branch. main and Test cannot merge into one branch because the test methods will not work on the main branch. There are 2 tags, v0.2 and v1.0. Make sure to always use v1.0 when downloading tag for testing. (v1.0 corresponds to the main branch)
